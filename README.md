- RescuMe App

- Current idea
1. Real-time GPS mapping
2. Profile making up (linking up with national id)
3. Creating a health profile (necessary if patient has medical condition and can require medical attention in times of disaster)
4. Map shows hotspots(nearby damaged areas by the disaster)
5. Shows the position of rescue teams
6. Has a become volunteer button, which provides basic training to the user so that if there is a disaster in their neighbourhood they can be mobilised to go help
7. Chat assistant with the relief command centre 
8. Optimized route selection: can be caluclated using an algorithm to find the shortest distane possible between the rescue team and the afflicted people, and there will be an optional 'Suggest Route' button if which the person can suggest a route on the map with checkpoints or by drawing a line around their neighbourhood (in cases where the stuck person knows there neighbourhood better than the rescue team professionals and are aware of the routes which are available and blocked as well as any unofficial routes to reach neighbourhood, like jumping a fence or wall)
